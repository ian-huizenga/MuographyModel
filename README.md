# Simple muon detector, capapble of reconstructing hit location with a precision of a few milimetres

This repository contains all the components used to create a novel type of muon detector, one which uses light yield on a rectangular scintillator instead of typical (time of flight)TOF or scintillating rods to determine position

It also contains a model to verify said detector, as well as a research paper documenting the entire process.

Finally, a component list has been provided. The total cost comes out to roughly â‚¬ 500,-. 

This allows anyone to create a relatively cost effective way of precisely determining a muon impact location with an accuracy on the order of ~4mm.
